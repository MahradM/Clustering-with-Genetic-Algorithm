# Clustering with Genetic Algorithm on Dry Beans Dataset

## Overview
This project explores the application of Genetic Algorithms (GA) to perform clustering analysis on the Dry Beans Dataset. Genetic Algorithms are heuristic search algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. They are particularly useful for optimization and search problems where traditional methods may be impractical.


## Dataset
The Dry Beans Dataset used in this project contains various features related to different dry beans classes.
